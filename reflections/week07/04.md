## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

i think one of the biggest principles we used from this weeks reading was implementing UX as much as we could while still planning each section of what we needed to ge done for the partner project

2. What went well this week?

i think the communication was really good between me and my partner. even though we didn't get a ton of the project done we were able to agree on many of the decisions we made for the project.

3. What would you do differently?

i think i would take more time in the beginning rushing into the project to get started in the end slowed us down because there were times where we had to sit and think about what we wanted to do.
