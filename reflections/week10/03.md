the information in a single row will be one of of the objects from your database. a column is a property of that object lik name or body.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
  name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
  age VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL
  )default charset utf8 COMMENT '';
