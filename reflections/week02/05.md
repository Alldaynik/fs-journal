the beginning of this week was pretty tough for me. a lot of the creating of functions was a little tough but as wednesday came around i started to pick up on everything. i struggled the most with for loops and conditionals. they made 0 sense but after doing the boss assignment, i went home and watch array methods and if statement and i felt good going into the checkpoint
