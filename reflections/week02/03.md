## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

the elements tab allows you to see and break down the HTML and the CSS. this can be helpful when debugging because. if their is something that isnt appearing on the page but it is in your code you can see what is directly affecting it or you can go and manipulate the code so that it does what you want and you can add it to the webpage.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

a better way to debug code it to type "debugger" in the HTML. this will run a debug system so that when you are tying to figure out what the problem, debugger will play your page and read you all the error that come up

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I enjoyed this assignment. one of my biggest takeaways was understanding functions and how there is different functions that are need to create a  fully functioning app. also naming is super important. It is smart to name functions based of what they will be doing.
