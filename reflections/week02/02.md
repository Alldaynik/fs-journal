## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

the three ways to write a function is a function declaration. this defines a names function. the second way is a function expression. this defines a named function or a anonymous function. the last one is arrow function expression. this is a shorter way of writing a function expression. there isnt much difference between there besides the syntax and that function expressions can define anonymous functions as well.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters are used to help define the functions. a function can pass up to 255 parameters. arguments are the values received from the function when the function is invoked or called to action.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

higher order functions are when functions are passed through another function or a function returns another function. for example:

function guessPriority() {
let priorityPackages = currentPackages.filter(
(package) => package.heavy == true
);
