3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

the BCW-template first takes the heavy lifting off of fully understanding what exactly each part of the proxy state does. the DOM is constantly changing through different inputs and allowing code to change based off of those inputs is important. code need to flexible to where there is certain outputs the come with each input. it allows for a smooth flow of the DOM.
