## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

in essence Encapsulation is the grouping of like data. access to this data is restricted from the outside.  

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

enclosures mark Objects as private and this wouldn't allow users to access them. the underscore strictly marks functions as private to the dev knows that a function is only for the devs use and not the users to see 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

we create private by putting them in the scope of a function. this way the function can publicly use them but outside side of that scope they are private.
