## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
 
 the two common operations are get and set. the get operation returns the values stored in the key of an object. the set operation does the same thing as get  but can take in 3 argument instead of just 2.


2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

we have to make sure that there is a key to be defined in the object. if there is no key and then it will become undefined.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

some of the benefits of the proxy objects is allowing to call to real objects. it also allows it to watch for a change.
