## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

a Pseudo-Class adds styling to different selectors and selectors add style to the HTML sheet. Some common Pseudo classed we would use are :before, :after, and :hover

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity allows for certain rules to be applied to a elements when there are many different rules trying to target that element. It can be beneficial when you want to change certain elements with out having to change all of them.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
   when using the !important feature, i believe that using it too much will cause certain elements not to work because it wont know which element is the most important. I also think that it will only chose one !important feature.so if you change the !important tag, it will also change what is "important" and that will take president over other !important tags.
