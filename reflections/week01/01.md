## Questions

Git is a bridge between your code. it allows you to transfer code between different systems while saving each version of your code.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

it is important to have multiple branches because when developers are looking at code that has similar structure, they are able to combine the different code. and bridge anything that is needed from each code.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a local repository. This means that it local for that current developer to use and work on. GitHub is a remote repository which mean that once the code is pushed to GitHub, other developers can see and access that code as well as make whatever changes are need for that code.
