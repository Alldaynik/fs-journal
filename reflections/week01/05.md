This first week was really fun in my opinion. after going threw the pre-course work, much of the HTML and CSS properties felt like review. i for sure feel a ton better using each and and im very comfortable with each now. i think my biggest struggle with this this week was bootstrap. i understand the set up and how to set up my page with the containers, rows and col's. knowing here to put the utility classed to move the content around was a little hard. when something didnt work, it got a little frustrating. i would eventually get there but it would be a long process to ge there and understand how and why what i did worked.
