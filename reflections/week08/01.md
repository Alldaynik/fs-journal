## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It allows you to show employers your skills and what you are good at.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

the projects you have provided in your portfolio. you want to stand out to employers and you want to show them that you are different from other candidates. If you can provide different projects that can show off these skills then this could give you the better advantage.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I think think right now i have 4-5 projects that i would provide. i would start with the first two projects(mock page and moon miner) for sure. these two projects show the start of my journey are a developer. they don't look great but they would allow me to show my improvement ove the course. i would also provide wayfinder and tower. I think these two i have done the best on so far and have been very confident in building. this will allow me to show muy progress from the start to now.
