## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

communication on a small team is important because it keeps everything organized and certain jobs aren't being questioned on who is doing them. this also keeps the client involved on everything that is going on.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

at first sizes of teams were 7 plus or minus 2. now the recommendation is 3-9. the smaller team is something that the client seems more appealed to. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

good service cheap wont be fast
good service fast wont be cheap 
fast service cheap wont be good

the tradeoffs will allow for the team to set real and achievable expectations for the project.
