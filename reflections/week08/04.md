## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

in vue you can do unit testing which is testing small ounces of code at a time 
you can also do component testing which requires you tp have a component mounted and test to see if that component works. 
the last test is end to end testing. this helps validate what you user will be doing in the application. it test all the different layers that are in the app.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
 i think the unit testing is the most important because it allows you to code small and miss small. writing a bunch of code then testing after will cause a headache if something fails

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

i think the component testing is the least useful. this can be included in the unit test.
