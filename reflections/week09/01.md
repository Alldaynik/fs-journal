## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

we are using a vue dat picker because that is going to be the main portion of the application. but other than that, we do not have any other external sources that we are using. 

2. What went well so far?

our communication has been very good. during our stand ups and sprint meeting we get a lot figured out and it allows for our coding session to be much smoother

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I think our coding session could be a little more efficient and beneficial if we spent a little more time trying to find a solution on our own rather asking for help
