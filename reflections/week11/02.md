## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

primary key is when the key is combing from the database and a foreign key is when it is coming form another table 

2. What is an `Alias`?

alias is when you give a sub name for a variable or objet

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

internal List<Patient> GetAllPatientsByDoctorId(int id)
    {
       string sql = @"
      SELECT
      p.*
      FROM patients p
      JOIN doctors d ON d.id = id 
      WHERE p.id = d.patientId
      ";
      return _db.Query<Profile, Patient, Patient>(sql, (prof, vault)=>{
        vault.Creator = prof;
        return vault;
      }, new { creatorId }).ToList();
    }
